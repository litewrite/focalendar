# [Focalendar](http://focalendar.com)

Busting 31 boxes – a proper calendar which lets you focus your plans.

Inspired by [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2010/03/28/more-ideas-than-time-logarithmic-calendar-view) and more alternative calendar concepts.



## Design

* **time is linear**, unlike month & week views in normal calendars, time just flows in one direction
* **interface is inherent**, no interface controls when the problem can be solved more elegantly
* **everything is an event**, tasks should not be separated from events



## Technology

* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
* [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)
* [remoteStorage.js](http://remotestoragejs.com)
* [Date.js](http://datejs.com)
* [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com)
* [hCalendar](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar)
